# Point-of-Sale-Demo
This is a repo to showcase my personal project to create a Point of Sale system to help a retail store transition from a traditional handwritten receipt to a digital receipt. 

This project is still ongoing. The demo video will be updated along with new features added to this program. At some point, an exe file of the program will be uploaded for anyone to try on their own.

Note: For privacy reasons, all of the product, prices, address, and name are fake. They do not correlate to any real products.
